Step1:
get data ready(turn into tensors)

step2:
build or pick a pretrained model to suit your problem
step2.5:
pick a loss function and optimizer
build a training loop

step 3:
fit the model to the dtata and make a prediction

step 4:
evaluate


step5:

improve through experimentation

step6: save and reload your trained model
